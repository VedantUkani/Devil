# DEVIL

DEVIL is a small experimental programming language designed during a university project.
Rather than focusing on ease of use, DEVIL was built mainly to explore how programming languages work internally â€” including tokenizing, parsing, and evaluation.

The syntax is intentionally quirky and challenging in places, making it a creative exercise in understanding the fundamentals of language design.
DEVIL programs are written with a .devi extension and executed via a Prolog-based interpreter.

# Key Features

- Variable Declarations: integer, boolean, float, string

- Control Structures: if, else, while, for

- Expressions: Arithmetic, boolean, ternary operations

- Print Statements: Custom syntax using print#"string"#

- Custom Grammar: Built with DCG rules

- Simple Execution: Run .devi files easily through SWI-Prolog

# Project Structure

- devi_tokenizer.pl	Tokenizes the input .devi program
- devi_grammer.pl	Defines the grammar of the DEVIL language
- devi_parser.pl	Parses token lists into a syntax tree
- devi_evaluator.pl	Evaluates the parsed syntax tree and executes
- devi_executer.pl	Main file to execute .devi programs
- samples/		Sample .devi programs to test
- README.md		Project instructions and documentation

# How to Run a DEVIL Program

- Step 1: Install SWI-Prolog
- 	Download and install SWI-Prolog for your system from https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html

- Step 2: Clone the Repository
- 	git clone https://github.com/VedantUkani/Devil.git
-  	cd devil

- Step 3: Prepare a .devi Program
-	You can use the provided examples inside the samples/ folder or write your own .devi files.

- Step 4: Execute the Program
- 	Normal run:
- 	swipl -g run -s devi_executer.pl -- samples/test1.devi

- 	Debug run (shows tokens and parsed tree):
- 	swipl -g run -s devi_executer.pl -- samples/test1.devi --debug
